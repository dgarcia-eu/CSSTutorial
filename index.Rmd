# Computational Social Science

## *Computational* in Computational Social Science
It can have three meanings:

- **Digital**<br> 
Based on large datasets of human behavior, for example produced by the Web and social media

- **Computerized**<br>
The quantitative analysis of data in an automated, tractable, repeatable, and extensible fashion

- **Generative**<br>
Application of data and results to design of agent-based models that explain complex social phenomena and motivate interventions

---

## New Data for the Social and Behavioral Sciences
<br>
- **Big Data:** Observing large and diverse sets of humans

- **Fast Data:** Quantifying human behavior in real time

- **Long Data:** Retrieving longitudinal data and at various timescales

- **Deep Data:** Gathering persistent information on individuals

- **Mixed Data:** Combining heterogeneous and unstructured data

- **Weird Data:** Analyzing behavior unobservable in experiments or surveys

---


## Strengths and weaknesses of digital trace data

**Strengths:**
- Complementary approach to traditional survey and experimental methods
- Unprecedented scales and granularities
- Ease of data access, replicability of results
- Potentially high external validity, behavior in vivo

**Weaknesses:**
- Limits to internal validity: Lack of counterfactuals hinders causal analysis
- Self-selection bias: Who talks? Normalization issues: Who is silent?
- Data gatekeepers, Twitter as a model organism
- Intractability of black-box predictions and data piñatas

Frequency of social process terms:
- Very similar before the attacks
- Strong difference after the attacks
- Difference lasts for months

Similar effect for prosocial terms and shared values terms
]

---

## Conclusions

- Terrorist attacks trigger collective emotions that we can observe online

- Terms related to social resilience increase after collective emotions

- Individuals expressing stronger emotions used on average more terms related to social processes, prosocial behavior, and shared values

- Collective emotions are not just venting, they can keep us together

- Negative effects: inter-group conflict, intolerance, short-term orientation...

## Approaches to Polarization

**Opinion polarization:** Two opinion groups with extreme distance in between
[Political Polarization in the American Public. Fiorina & Abrams. Annual Review of Political Science (2008)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.153836)

**Relational polarization:** Social structure divided into two groups with high internal connectivity and low inter-group connectivity

## EAT-Lancet and yes2meat: Summary

- We mapped the digital backlash to EAT-Lancet on Twitter through #yes2meat
- Birth of #yes2meat preceded the release of the report
- Four communities: pro-EAT-Lancet, skeptic, pro-yes2meat, and vegan
- Information flow from pro-yes2meat to skeptic community after report
- Diet polarization: liberal vegan vs conservative keto

Example of emerging polarization towards hyperpolarization as in Weighted Balance Theory

## The Facebook Gender Divide: Summary

- Measure of gender divide with FB data comparable to surveys
- This measure captures offline gender equality indices across countries
- Temporal correlation between FGD and changes in economic gender eq.
- Superlinear scaling of FB activity with penetration: positive externality

Social media might also work as a *digital provide*. Is Facebook helping women to find employment in countries with high gender inequality?

# Privacy Risks in Online Platforms

- A risk for informational self-determination:
Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior [(Kosinski et al, 2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802)

- Facebook Likes predict personality, sexual orientation, etc

Individualized solutions to privacy risks
> ”Providing users with transparency and control over their information, leading to an individually controlled balance between the promises and perils of the Digital Age.” *(Kosinski et al, 2013)*

**Can we guarantee individual control over online privacy?**

## The Problem of Shadow Profiles

**Facebook Shadow Profile:**  
A file that Facebook keeps on you containing data it pulls from looking at the information that your friends voluntarily provide. [*(Digital Trends, 2013)*](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/what-exactly-is-a-facebook-shadow-profile/)

- 2011: Europe-vs-Facebook files complaint on shadow profiles

- 2013: Bug reveals private information of 6 million users

- Some users notice their shadow profiles with mobile numbers

- Apr 2014: 1B users of Facebook for mobile share  contact lists

- Aug 2016: Whatsapp and Facebook share information

Not a problem unique to Facebook: also in Twitter, Google, Amazon...

## Auditing Shadow Profiles

**Shadow profile hypothesis:**
The data shared by the users of an online platform predicts of personal information of non-users

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shadowidea.png")
```
**Approach:** historical audit to evaluate how social networking sites could have predicted information of individuals who were not users yet

- Full track of publicly available data
- Focus on first 20 million users
- 3M profiles with public information
- Profiles contain gender, marital status, and relationship interests

### Predictive power grows with network size and disclosure

Performance of predictor of personal information of non-users grows with: 
network size (t), disclosure tendencies of users (ρ), and their product (t∗ρ)

## Study 2: Location in Twitter

.pull-left[

```
]
.pull-right[
- Random sample of 1,017 users
  - excl. bots, mass media
- Ego network of reply links
  - 68,447 alters
- Timelines: 157M tweets
- Location from profile text + Google Maps API
- Tweet metadata to identify users sharing contact lists
]

## Twitter shadow profile test

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1100, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/TwitterProblem.png")
```

- Data represents a bidirectional social network
- Joined date of users shows network growth
- Tweet metadata contains posting app: disclosing users are only those who post at least once from Twitter mobile apps (shared contact lists)
- Predicting location of users who didn't join yet based on disclosing friends already on Twitter
---

## Location prediction and heterogeneity

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1000, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/alters.png")
```

- Location prediction of non-users greatly outperforms null model
- Individuals with more alters sharing contact lists in Twitter have lower error
